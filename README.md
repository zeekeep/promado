# Pomodoro Timer

The Pomodoro Technique is a famous time management method that you split your work hours into small sessions to maintain your concentration by eliminating interruptions. You can use traditional 25 minutes Pomodoro timers or schedule your own focus time by clicking the settings button.

When it comes to time management methods, the Pomodoro technique is great. It’s quite
effective and pretty easy to follow. The Pomodoro Process has four primary steps:
● Setting a 25-minute timer for a task to be done.
● Work on the task at hand for 25 minutes until the timer chimers.
● Take a short break (typically for 5-10 minutes).
● After four pomodoros, take a long break (15-20 minutes).
Your challenge is to write an algorithm that includes these steps.
You also need to decide on great-looking visuals that are not distracting in any way.
In addition, there needs to be a progress bar and a counter to count the number of Pomodoro.
This challenge is also meant to test your knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Please use React.
